Property inspection app

This is the repository for the property inspection app. First for IOS and Android and possibly Windows later on.
Basic overview of the app.

- App requires a sign in, that will authenticate existing Verirent users.
- Be able to load a list of properties from the DB on the server and keep a local cache.
- Agents will then be able to search for properties using a description or address search. (Perhaps GPS based in future)
- Agent can then view all inspection notes listed on this property.
- Agent can then add additional notes, and use mobile device camera to add images.
- Separate notes and images with notes should be available. Just to make it easier to add notes to a specific image.
- Voice notes as a feature, but not crucial for first viable product
- Data should be uploaded in background to the server and have a clear indication if data was submitted.
- Added data from the mobile app should be flagged on the normal web application, including the time posted and the user.
